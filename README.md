# Summary

UD Breton-KEB is a treebank of Breton that has been manually annotated according to the Universal Dependencies guidelines. The 
tokenisation guidelines and morphological annotation comes from a finite-state morphological analyser of Breton released as part
of the [Apertium project](http://www.apertium.org).

# Introduction

The text in the corpus comes from a variety of sources: Grammar book sentences, sentences from the Breton Wikipedia, administrative
texts from _Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg_ and short prose texts from _Bremaik_. In addition there are two traditional songs. 

## Translations

Out of 888 sentences, 256 have translations in French, 275 have translations in English and 347 have translations which have been
machine translated from Breton to French using [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org)
